  > NOTE
  >
  > Status returns information about whether a remote end is in a state in which it can create new sessions, but may additionally include arbitrary meta information that is specific to the implementation.
  >
  > The remote end’s readiness state is represented by the ready property of the body, which is false if an attempt to create a session at the current time would fail. However, the value true does not guarantee that a New Session command will succeed.

  Implementations may optionally include additional meta information as part of the body, but the top-level properties `ready` and `message` are reserved and must not be overwritten.

  The remote end steps are:

  1. Let body be a new JSON Object with the following properties:
    * `"ready"`
      The remote end’s readiness state.

    * `"message"`
      An implementation-defined string explaining the remote end’s readiness state.

  1. Return success with data _body_.
