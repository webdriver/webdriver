description: |-
  WebDriver provides commands for interacting with the operating system window containing the current top-level browsing context. Because different operating systemsâ€™ window managers provide different abilities, not all of the commands in this section can be supported by all remote ends. Support for these commands is determined by the window dimensioning/positioning capability. Where a command is not supported, an unsupported operation error is returned.
