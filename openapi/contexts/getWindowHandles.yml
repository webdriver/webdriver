  The order in which the window handles are returned is arbitrary.

  The remote end steps are:

  1. Let _handles_ be a JSON List.

  1. For each top-level browsing context in the remote end, push the associated window handle onto handles.

  1. Return success with data _handles_.

  > EXAMPLE 9
  >
  > In order to determine whether or not a particular interaction with the browser opens a new window, one can obtain the set of window handles before the interaction is performed and compare it with the set after the action is performed.
