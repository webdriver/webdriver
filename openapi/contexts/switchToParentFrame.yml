  > NOTE
  >
  > The Switch to Parent Frame command sets the current browsing context for future commands to the parent of the current browsing context.

  The remote end steps are:

  1. If the current browsing context is no longer open, return error with error code no such window.

  1. Handle any user prompts and return its value if it is an error.

  1. If the current browsing context is not equal to the current top-level browsing context, set the current browsing context to the parent browsing context of the current browsing context.

  1. Update any implementation-specific state that would result from the user selecting the current browsing context for interaction, without altering OS-level focus.

  1. Return success with data `null`.
