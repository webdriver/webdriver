  > NOTE
  >
  > Switching window will select the current top-level browsing context used as the target for all subsequent commands. In a tabbed browser, this will typically make the tab containing the browsing context the selected tab.

  The remote end steps are:

  1. Let _handle_ be the result of getting the property `"handle"` from the parameters argument.

  1. If _handle_ is undefined, return error with error code invalid argument.

  1. If there is an active user prompt, that prevents the focussing of another top-level browsing context, return error with error code unexpected alert open.

  1. If _handle_ is equal to the associated window handle for some top-level browsing context in the current session, set the sessionâ€™s current browsing context to that browsing context.

  1. Otherwise, return error with error code no such window.

  1. Update any implementation-specific state that would result from the user selecting the current browsing context for interaction, without altering OS-level focus.

  1. Return success with data `null`.
