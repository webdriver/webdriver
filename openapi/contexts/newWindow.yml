  Create a new top-level browsing context.

  The remote end steps are:

  1. If the implementation does not support creating new top-level browsing contexts, return error with error code unsupported operation.

  1. If the current top-level browsing context is no longer open, return error with error code no such window.

  1. Handle any user prompts and return its value if it is an error.

  1. Let _type hint_ be the result of getting the property `"type"` from the parameters argument.

  1. Create a new top-level browsing context by running the window open steps with url set to `"about:blank"`, target set to the empty string, and features set to `"noopener"` and the user agent configured to create a new browing context. This must be done without invoking the focusing steps for the created browsing context. If type hint has the value `"tab"`, and the implementation supports multiple browsing context in the same OS window, the new browsing context should share an OS window with the current browsing context. If type hint is `"window"`, and the implementation supports multiple browsing contexts in seperate OS windows, the created browsing context should be in a new OS window. In all other cases the details of how the browsing context is presented to the user are implementation defined.

  1. Let handle be the associated window handle of the newly created window.

  1. Let type be `"tab"` if the newly created window shares an OS-level window with the current browsing context, or `"window"` otherwise.

  1. Let _result_ be a new JSON Object initialised with:

    * `"handle"`

      The value of handle.

    * `"type"`

      The value of type.

  1. Return success with data _result_.
