  > NOTE
  > The command causes the user agent to navigate the current top-level browsing context to a new location.

  If the session is not in a secure TLS state, no certificate errors that would normally cause the user agent to abort and show a security warning are to hinder navigation to the requested address.

  > EXAMPLE 8
  > To navigate the current top-level browsing context of the session with ID 1 to https://example.com, the local end would POST to /session/1/url with the body:
  >
  > `{"url": "https://example.com"}`

  The remote end steps are:

  1. If the current top-level browsing context is no longer open, return error with error code no such window.

  1. Let __url__ be the result of getting the property `url` from the parameters argument.

  1. If __url__ is not an absolute URL or is not an absolute URL with fragment or not a local scheme, return error with error code invalid argument.

  1. Handle any user prompts and return its value if it is an error.

  1. Let __current URL__ be the current top-level browsing context’s active document’s document URL.

  1. If __current URL__ and __url__ do not have the same absolute URL:

    1. If __timer__ has not been started, start a __timer__. If this algorithm has not completed before __timer__ reaches the session’s session page load timeout in milliseconds, return an error with error code timeout.

  1. Navigate the current top-level browsing context to __url__.

  1. If __url__ is special except for file and current __URL__ and __URL__ do not have the same absolute URL :

    1. Try to wait for navigation to complete.

    1. Try to run the post-navigation checks.

  1. Set the current browsing context to the current top-level browsing context.

  1. If the current top-level browsing context contains a refresh state pragma directive of __time__ 1 second or less, wait until the refresh timeout has elapsed, a new navigate has begun, and return to the first step of this algorithm.

  1. Return success with data `null`.
