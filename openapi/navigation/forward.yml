  > NOTE

  > This command causes the browser to traverse one step forwards in the joint session history of the current top-level browsing context.

  The remote end steps are:

  1. If the current top-level browsing context is no longer open, return error with error code no such window.

  1. Handle any user prompts and return its value if it is an error.

  1. Traverse the history by a delta 1 for the current browsing context.

  1. If the previous step completed results in a `pageHide` event firing, wait until `pageShow` event fires or for the session page load timeout milliseconds to pass, whichever occurs sooner.

  1. If the previous step completed by the session page load timeout being reached, and user prompts have been handled, return error with error code timeout.

  1. Return success with data `null`.
