WebDriver gives each [session](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/#dfn-sessions) a unique [session ID](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/#dfn-session-id) that can be used to differentiate one session from another, allowing multiple user agents to be controlled from a single HTTP server, and allowing sessions to be routed via a multiplexer (known as an [intermediary node](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/#dfn-intermediary-nodes)).\n\nA WebDriver __session__ represents the connection between a local end and a specific remote end.\n\nA session is started when a New Session is invoked. It is an error to send any commands before starting a session, or to continue to send commands after the session has been closed. Maintaining session continuity between commands to the remote end requires passing a session ID.\n\nA session is torn down at some later point; either explicitly by invoking Delete Session, or implicitly when Close Window is called at the last remaining top-level browsing context.\n\nAn intermediary node will maintain an __associated session__ for each active session. This is the session on the upstream neighbor that is created when the intermediary node executes the New Session command. Closing a session on an intermediary node will also close the session of the associated session.\n\nAll commands, except New Session and Status, have an associated __current session__, which is the session in which that command will run.\n\nA remote end has an associated list of __active sessions__, which is a list of all sessions that are currently started. A remote end that is not an intermediary node has at most one active session at a given time.\n\nA remote end has an associated __maximum active sessions__ (an integer) that defines the number of active sessions that are supported. This may be “unlimited” for intermediary nodes, but must be exactly one for a remote end that is an endpoint node.\n\nA session has an associated __session ID__ (a string representation of a UUID) used to uniquely identify this session. Unless stated otherwise it is `null`.\n\nA session has an associated __current browsing context__, which is the browsing context against which commands will run.\n\nA session has an associated __current top-level browsing context__, which is the current browsing context if it itself is a top-level browsing context, and otherwise is the top-level browsing context of the current browsing context.\n\nA session has an associated __session timeouts__ that records the timeout duration values used to control the behavior of script evaluation, navigation, and element retrieval.\n\nA session has an associated __page loading strategy__, which is one of the keywords from the table of page load strategies. Unless stated otherwise, it is normal.\n\nA session has an associated __secure TLS__ state that indicates whether untrusted or self-signed TLS certificates should be trusted for the duration of the WebDriver session. If it is unset, this indicates that certificate- or TLS errors that occur upon navigation should be suppressed. The state can be unset by providing an \"acceptInsecureCerts\" capability with the value true. Unless stated otherwise, it is set.\n\nA session has an associated strict file interactability state which is a boolean.\n\nA session has an associated user prompt handler. Unless stated otherwise it is in the dismiss and notify state.\n\nA session has an associated list of active input sources.\n\nA session has an associated input state table.\n\nA session has an associated input cancel list.\n\nA session has an associated __request queue__ which is a queue of requests that are currently awaiting processing.\n\nWhen asked to __close the session__, a remote end must take the following steps:\n\n1. Perform the following substeps based on the remote end’s type:\n  * __Remote end is an endpoint node__\n    1. Set the webdriver-active flag to false.\n    2. An endpoint node must close any top-level browsing contexts associated with the session, without prompting to unload.\n  * __Remote end is an intermediary node__\n    1. Close the associated session. If this causes an error to occur, complete the remainder of this algorithm before returning the error.\n2. Remove the current session from active sessions.\n3. Perform any implementation-specific cleanup steps.\n4. If an error has occurred in any of the steps above, return the error, otherwise return success with data `null`.\n\nClosing a session might cause the associated browser process to be killed. It is assumed that any implementation-specific cleanup steps are performed after the response has been sent back to the client so that the connection is not prematurely closed."},{"name":"Timeouts","externalDocs":{"url":"https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/#timeouts"},"description":"A timeouts configuration is a record of the different timeouts that control the behavior of [script evaluation](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/#executing-script), [navigation](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/#navigation), and [element retrieval](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/#elements):\n\nField                 | Default | JSON key     | Optional† | Nullable | Description†\n----------------------|---------|--------------|-----------|----------|--------------\nScript timeout        | 30,000  | `\"script\"`   | ✓         | ✓        | Specifies when to interrupt a script that is being [evaluated](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/#executing-script).<br><br>A [`null`](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/#dfn-null) value implies that scripts should never be interrupted, but instead run indefinitely.\nPage load timeout     | 300,000 | `\"pageLoad\"` | ✓         |          | Provides the timeout limit used to interrupt an explicit [navigation](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/#dfn-navigating) attempt.\nImplicit wait timeout | 0       | `\"implicit\"` | ✓         |          | Specifies a time to wait for the [element location strategy](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/#dfn-strategy) to complete when [location an element](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/#element-retrieval).\n\nThe [timeouts configuration](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/#dfn-timeouts-configuration)’s [JSON serialization](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/#dfn-json-serialization) is expressed as a JSON [Object](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/#dfn-object) with the following properties:\n\n* `\"script\"`\n  Script timeout’s value, if set, or its default value.\n* `\"pageLoad\"`\n  Page load timeout’s value, if set, or its default value.\n* `\"implicit\"`\n  Implicit wait timeout’s value, if set, or its default value.\n\nTo JSON deserialize an input value into a timeouts configuration record:\n\n1.

An [intermediary node](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/#dfn-intermediary-nodes) is free to define [extension capabilities](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/#dfn-extension-capability) to assist in this process, however, these specific capabilities must not be forwarded to the [endpoint node](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/#dfn-endpoint-node).\n\nIf the [intermediary node](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/#dfn-intermediary-nodes) requires additional information unrelated to user agent features, it is recommended that this information be passed as top-level parameters, and not as part of the requested [capabilities](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/#dfn-capability). An [intermediary node](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/#dfn-intermediary-nodes) must forward custom, top-level parameters (i.e. non-[capabilities](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/#dfn-capability)) to subsequent [remote end](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/#dfn-remote-ends) nodes.\n\n> __EXAMPLE 7__\n>\n> An [intermediary node](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/#dfn-intermediary-nodes) might require authentication on [creating a new session](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/#dfn-new-sessions). This authentication is an argument to the [New Session](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/#dfn-new-sessions) command itself and not the user agent’s [capabilities](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/#dfn-capability). Therefore, the authentication should be passed as a top-level parameter and not embedded in `capabilities`:\n>\n> ```js\n> {\n>   \"user\": \"alice\",\n>    \"password\": \"hunter2\",\n>    \"capabilities\": {…}\n> }\n> ```\n> However, because an [intermediary node](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/#dfn-intermediary-nodes) cannot forward [extension capabilities](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/#dfn-extension-capability) specific to that implementation to an [endpoint node](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/#dfn-endpoint-node), the following is also permitted by this specification:\n>\n> ```js\n> {\n>   \"capabilities\": {\n>     \"alwaysMatch\": {\n>       \"cloud:user\": \"alice\",\n>       \"cloud:password\": \"hunter2\",\n>       \"platformName\": \"linux\"\n>     },\n>     \"firstMatch\": [\n>       {\"browserName\": \"chrome\"},\n>       {\"browserName\": \"edge\"}\n>     ]\n>   }\n> }\n> ```\n>\n> Once all [capabilities are merged](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/#dfn-merging-capabilities) from this example, an [endpoint node](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/#dfn-endpoint-node) would receive [New Session](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/#dfn-new-sessions) capabilities identical to:\n>\n> ```js\n> [\n>   {\"browserName\": \"chrome\", \"platformName\": \"linux\"},\n>   {\"browserName\": \"edge\", \"platformName\": \"linux\"}\n> ]\n> ```\n\nThe remote end steps are:\n\n1. If the maximum active sessions is equal to the length of the list of active sessions, return error with error code session not created.\n1. If the remote end is an intermediary node, take implementation-defined steps that either result in returning an error with error code session not created, or in returning a success with data that is isomorphic to that returned by remote ends according to the rest of this algorithm. If an error is not returned, the intermediary node must retain a reference to the session created on the upstream node as the associated session such that commands may be forwarded to this associated session on subsequent commands.\n\n  > NOTE\n  >\n  > How this is done is entirely up to the implementation, but typically the `sessionId`, and URL and URL prefix of the upstream remote end will need to be tracked.\n\n1.
